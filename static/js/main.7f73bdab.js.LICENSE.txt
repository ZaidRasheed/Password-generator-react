//! generate a password according the options selected

//! the refresh for a new password

//! to make sure theres at least one of each character type in the password we include one random and afterwards the remaining are random characters

//! we also need to change the fill color length to make it move with the thumb

//! we need to generate a new password whenever the length or type changes or when the user wants a new one

//! when the content of the desired password changes we have to update the requirements

//! whenever the slider value changes we have to change the value of manual input accordingly
